    <h2>Ryan</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Ryan Christensen. I'm currently working towards a degree in computer science. I'm pretty new to coding 
        and I've really liked it so far. </p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include crocheting, reading, listening to audiobooks, and playing piano. 
        I've been playing piano for about 12 years now and I love it! I'll include a link to some of the music I've arranged. </p>
    <p>I'm currently serving as a service missionary in Idaho after about a year of serving as a proselyting missionary in the 
        Louisville Kentucky mission. I love being able to serve the Lord and be with family at the same time. </p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church basically my whole life and I love the peace and comfort that comes from knowing that 
        I can always find comfort in Jesus Christ and His gospel, even if everything else is crazy. My favorite scripture is 
        Mosiah 26:30, because I love how no matter what happens or what we do, the Savior will always forgive us. </p>
