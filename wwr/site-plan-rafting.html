    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this site is to help my business grow and thrive. With this 
      website, I can post information on the rafting services we provide. People
      who have used our services can share their experiences and newcomers will
      be able to see the fun experiences that we have to offer. As more customers come
      through the website, we will earn more revenue and expand our business to offer
      even more services. 
      </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My target customers are people who want to add an
      adventurous experience to their lives. Whether they are a 
      family on vacation looking to make some memories, a group
      of friends who need a fun activity, or even just a person
      who is looking for a break from the monotony of everyday
      life, we can give them the breathtaking, exciting experience
      they are looking for. We will reach people through our website, 
      mainly designed for laptop and desktop, and share it through
      social media sites to help spread the word.

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
