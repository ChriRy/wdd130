          In my spare time, I like to work on composing and arranging music. I
          bounce around a lot in regards to genre; I've done musical theater,
          music from game and movie soundtracks, simplified pop songs for my
          piano students, and some joke music (which is one of my personal
          favorites.). I have a long list of ideas for future
          composing/arranging projects that I plan to work on in the future, but
          I'm always open to new ideas, so if there is a song you would like me
          to consider, send me a message.

            Learning to compose and arrange has been a long and not always
            enjoyable process. It's taken a lot of years of piano lessons and
            trial and error for me to get to where I am today (and honestly, I
            still have a long way to go). Playing music is tricky, but putting
            together that tricky-to-play music is another thing altogether. So if
            you want to learn to compose for yourself and you don't know where to
            start, send me your questions and concerns and I will try to help as
            much as I can. Or if you are already working on a piece and just want
            a second opinion, I can give it a look and give some constructive
            criticism and advice. Music takes a lot of trial and error (and I've
            experienced it), but it's always worth it in the end. So keep working
            on those projects and let me know how I can help.
