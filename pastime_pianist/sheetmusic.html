          In my spare time, I like to work on composing and arranging music. I
          bounce around a lot in regards to genre; I’ve done musical theater,
          music from game and movie soundtracks, simplified pop songs for my
          piano students, and some joke music (which is one of my personal
          favorites.). I have a long list of ideas for future
          composing/arranging projects that I plan to work on in the future, but
          I’m always open to new ideas, so if there is a song you would like me
          to consider, send me a message.

          Learning to compose and arrange has been a long and not always
          enjoyable process. It’s taken a lot of years of piano lessons and
          trial and error for me to get to where I am today (and honestly, I
          still have a long way to go). Playing music is tricky, but putting
          together that tricky-to-play music is another thing altogether. So if
          you want to learn to compose for yourself and you don’t know where to
          start, send me your questions and concerns and I will try to help as
          much as I can. Or if you are already working on a piece and just want
          a second opinion, I can give it a look and give some constructive
          criticism and advice. Music takes a lot of trial and error (and I’ve
          experienced it), but it’s always worth it in the end. So keep working
          on those projects and let me know how I can help.
