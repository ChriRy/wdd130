          <p class="question">Where did you learn to write/arrange music?</p>
          <img class="arrow" src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow" />
          <p class="answer">
            There's a lot behind that question. I've learned through experience
            that there isn't really one place to go to learn. Having a good
            background in piano has definitely played a big part in it. A lot of
            music theory goes into it, so learning that was important. A large
            part of it was a friend of mine showing me how to work with the chords
            of a song and kind of make it up as you go. That was a major turning
            point for me and helped me get started with really composing and
            arranging. But really the best way to learn is to just start doing it.
            For a long time I was hoping to find a class or website or video that
            would teach me exactly what I wanted to know. But ultimately, it was
            by just sitting down and trying to do it that helped me the most. I
            still have a lot to learn though, so if you have a background in music
            or composition, I'd appreciate any constructive criticism you have to
            offer.

          <img class="arrow" src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow" />
          <p class="answer">
            To make nice looking sheet music, I use MuseScore 4, which is totally
            free and you should definitely check it out if you're looking for a
            good notation program. But I prefer to start using pencil and paper to
            work on music. I work it all out on paper, then use MuseScore as a
            sort of spell check to help make sure all of my rhythms and notations
            are correct.
