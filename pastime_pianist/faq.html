        <p>How long have you been playing piano?</p>

        <p>
          There’s a lot behind that question. I’ve learned through experience
          that there isn’t really one place to go to learn. Having a good
          background in piano has definitely played a big part in it. A lot of
          music theory goes into it, so learning that was important. A large
          part of it was a friend of mine showing me how to work with the chords
          of a song and kind of make it up as you go. That was a major turning
          point for me and helped me get started with really composing and
          arranging. But really the best way to learn is to just start doing it.
          For a long time I was hoping to find a class or website or video that
          would teach me exactly what I wanted to know. But ultimately, it was
          by just sitting down and trying to do it that helped me the most. I
          still have a lot to learn though, so if you have a background in music
          or composition, I’d appreciate any constructive criticism you have to
          offer.

        <!-- question three -->
        <img src="images/question-mark.png" alt="question-mark" />
        <p>What program do you use to arrange?</p>
        <img src="images/arrow.png" alt="arrow" />
        <p>
          To make nice looking sheet music, I use MuseScore 4, which is totally
          free and you should definitely check it out if you’re looking for a
          good notation program. But I prefer to start using pencil and paper to
          work on music. I work it all out on paper, then use MuseScore as a
          sort of spell check to help make sure all of my rhythms and notations
          are correct.
