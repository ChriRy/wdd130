          Hi there, thanks for stopping by! I'm Ryan, a student and pianist
          located in the Rexburg area. If you're looking for a piano accompanist
          for a choir, musical number, or other performance, then I might be
          able to help you out! 
          I'm an accomplished pianist with experience as
          an accompanist and piano teacher. I love making music with people and
          making new connections with people!
        </p>

        <p id="p1">
          I'm also a composer and arranger, and it's one of my favorite things
          (hence, this website). If you want a song arranged for you to perform,
          or if you have a project in need of original music, reach out to me
          and let's talk!
        </p>
        <p id="p2">
          A word of warning; I am a college student with a busy course load, so
          I will need to make sure me and my schedule can handle helping out
          before I commit to anything. And, while I am accomplished at the
          piano, I am still in the process of developing my own skills, so I
          need to review any music I would need to play before I can commit.
          Practice takes time, and while I would love to help out everywhere,
          sometimes the music might be better suited for another musician.
