      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Hi there, thanks for stopping by! I'm Ryan, a student and pianist
        located in the Rexburg area. If you're looking for a piano accompanist
        for a choir, musical number, or other performance, then I might be able
        to help you out! I'm an accomplished pianist with experience as an
        accompanist and piano teacher. I love making music with people and
        making new connections with people. I'm also a composer and arranger,
        and it's one of my favorite things (hence, this website). If you want a
        song arranged for you to perform, or if you have a project in need of
        original music, reach out to me and let's talk! A word of warning; I am
        a college student with a busy course load, so I will need to make sure
        me and my schedule can handle helping out before I commit to anything.
        And, while I am accomplished at the piano, I am still in the process of
        developing my own skills, so I need to review any music I would need to
        play before I can commit. Practice takes time, and while I would love to
        help out everywhere, sometimes the music might be better suited for
        another musician.

      <h3>FAQ's</h3>
      <p>
        Here are some answers to questions that I've been asked about this in
        the past: How long have you been playing piano? 12 years Where did you
        learn to compose and arrange from? There's a lot behind that question.
        Having a good background in piano has definitely played a big part in
        it. A lot of music theory goes into it, so learning that was important.
        A big part of it was a friend of mine showing me how to work with the
        chords of a song and kind of make it up as you go. That was a big
        turning point for me and helped me get started with really composing and
        arranging. But really the best way to learn is to just start doing it.
        For a long time I was hoping to find a class or website or video that
        would teach me exactly what I wanted to know. But in the end, it was
        really just by doing it that i figured it out. I still have a lot to
        learn though, so if you have a background in music or composition, I'd
        appreciate any constructive criticism you have to offer. What program do
        you use to arrange? To make nice looking sheet music, I use MuseScore 4,
        which is totally free and you should definitely check it out if you're
        looking for a good notation program. But I prefer to start using pencil
        and paper to work on music. I work it all out on paper, then use
        MuseScore as a sort of spell check to help make sure all of my rhythms
        and notations are correct.
      </p>

      <h3>Compositions and Arrangements</h3>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I like to work on composing and arranging music. I
        bounce around a lot in regards to genre; I've done musical theater,
        music from game and movie soundtracks, simplified pop songs for my piano
        students, and some joke music (which is one of my personal favorites.).
        I have a long list of ideas for future composing/arranging projects that
        I plan to work on in the future, but I'm always open to new ideas, so if
        there is a song you would like me to consider, send me a message.
        Learning to compose and arrange has been a long and not always enjoyable
        process. It's taken a lot of years of piano lessons and trial and error
        for me to get to where I am today (and honestly, I still have a long way
        to go). Playing music is tricky, but putting together that
        tricky-to-play music is another thing altogether. So if you want to
        learn to compose for yourself and you don't know where to start, send me
        your questions and concerns and I will try to help as much as I can. Or
        if you are already working on a piece and just want a second opinion, I
        can give it a look and give some constructive criticism and advice.
        Music takes a lot of trial and error (and I've experienced it), but it's
        always worth it in the end. So keep working on those projects and let me
        know how I can help.
